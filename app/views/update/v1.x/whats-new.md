<a name="fortify" style="padding-top: 30px;">&nbsp;</a>
#### sprnva/fortify v1.0.6
changes in package
- restructured fortify to be more dynamic and customizable
- all authentication files are customizable and can be view in this directories:
	- Controllers : `app/controllers/Auth/`
	- Views : `app/views/auth/`
	- Route : `config/routes/auth.php`

To install fortify do this steps:

```bash
composer require sprnva/fortify

php vendor/sprnva/fortify/serve
```

To update existing fortify do this steps:

- check `compose.json` if fortify is present in the require option
	- if fortify is not present, install fortify.
	- if fortify is present in the require option, check the version and then we now update fortify using:

	```bash
	composer update
	```
	- delete the `app/views/layouts/profile.php` because we are no longer requiring this file using our fortify.
